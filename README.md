## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - Download from https://nodejs.org/
2. **LM Studio** - Download from https://lmstudio.ai/
3. Git (to clone the repository) - Download from https://git-scm.com/

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nico1091/tutor-ingenieria-gemma
cd Desarollo--gemma4-Hackhaton
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
The `.env` file is already included in the repository. Verify it contains:
```env
LM_STUDIO_URL=http://localhost:1234
LM_STUDIO_MODEL=google/gemma-2-9b-it
PORT=3000
```
If you need to change the port, edit the `.env` file directly.

4. Install and configure LM Studio:
   - Download and install LM Studio from https://lmstudio.ai/
   - Open LM Studio
   - In the sidebar, click on the search icon (🔍)
   - Search for: `google/gemma-2-9b-it`
   - Click "Download" to download the model (approx. 2-4 GB)
   - Wait for the download to complete
   - Go to "Local Server" (server icon in the sidebar)
   - Select the model `google/gemma-2-9b-it` in the dropdown
   - Configure the port to 1234
   - Click "Start Server"
   - Verify the server is running at `http://localhost:1234`

5. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
You should see: `Server running on http://localhost:3000`

6. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Common Troubleshooting

- **If port 3000 is occupied:** Change `PORT=3001` in the `.env` file
- **If LM Studio doesn't connect:** Verify that the LM Studio server is started and the port matches the one in `.env`
- **If the model is not found:** Search for `google/gemma-4-e4b` in LM Studio and download it
- **If npm install fails:** Try `npm install --force` or delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall
